# Titanic Dataset Analysis

Analyze the Titanic dataset using Python and data analysis libraries.

## Steps

1. Import required libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
2. Load Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Check for missing values and visualize using a heatmap.
4. Explore survival distribution by gender using countplots.
5. Cross-tabulate age and survival for insights.
6. Analyze survival based on family size (Parch and SibSp).
7. Impute missing age values using a random imputation function.
8. Label encode 'Sex' and 'Embarked' columns.
9. Drop 'Cabin', 'PassengerId', and 'Name' columns.
10. Transform 'Embarked' and 'Ticket' columns using label encoding.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into Titanic passengers' survival based on gender, age, family size, and more. Code can be adapted for further analysis.
